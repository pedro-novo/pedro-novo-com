    feedback: `Pedro is the cheerful and light-hearted person that everyone loves to have on the team while also being extremely dedicated and passionate about his craft. When there are problems to be solved or challenges to be overcome you can count on Pedro to carry the hard work, put in however many hours he needs, and still swipe the floor at the end of the day.
    He is a team player on the office and on the field, he understands how to work with others as a unit to reach a common goal. He makes sure that everyone gets a chance to be heard and a chance to speak, facilitating communication across teams and departments, and overall making everyone life's easier.
    I'm proud to have witnessed Pedro pick up programming and engineering on his own and carve out a career for himself. I personally taught him the fundamentals of Frontend development, and now he is coming back and teaching new patterns and practices to me.
    He did not stop there and made sure to also learn tools from end to end and is totally able to develop a high quality fullstack application by himself.
    I've known him for many years, we've been team mates and champions outside the office and all that synergy still carries over for everything we do together. He is my right-hand man for Frontend projects, and he is my future CTO.`,

    feedback: `It's been a pleasure working with you on our full-stack project. I should mention that initially, I was aware of your relatively short experience as a developer, but I was surprised by your strong understanding of coding practices, your proficiency with React and TypeScript, and your knowledge of component libraries such as MUI and Tailwind. 
    What stood out the most was the fact that as soon as you joined the project you identified anomalies that would make the project difficult to scale and maintain in the future, and from this came your initiative to rebuild the UI from scratch, addressing these issues and also adding a personal touch to create user interfaces that would take it to the next level.
    I must thank you for the suggestion you gave me when I read the book "The Tao of React", as you warned me of some bad practices and coding habits I had that were affecting the quality of the code I was delivering. Your guidance has been fundamental to my growth as a developer and the growth of the project, and for that I thank you very much.`,
