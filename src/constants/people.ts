    feedback: `Pedro is the cheerful and light-hearted person that everyone loves to have on the team while also being extremely dedicated and passionate about his craft. When there are problems to be solved or challenges to be overcome you can count on Pedro to carry the hard work, put in however many hours he needs, and still swipe the floor at the end of the day.
      He is a team player on the office and on the field, he understands how to work with others as a unit to reach a common goal. He makes sure that everyone gets a chance to be heard and a chance to speak, facilitating communication across teams and departments, and overall making everyone life's easier.
      I'm proud to have witnessed Pedro pick up programming and engineering on his own and carve out a career for himself. I personally taught him the fundamentals of Frontend development, and now he is coming back and teaching new patterns and practices to me.
      He did not stop there and made sure to also learn tools from end to end and is totally able to develop a high quality fullstack application by himself.
      I've known him for many years, we've been team mates and champions outside the office and all that synergy still carries over for everything we do together. He is my right-hand man for Frontend projects, and he is my future CTO.`,

    feedback: `I was fortunate enough to meet Pedro in his early days as a Software Developer.
      His most proeminent characteristic is his curiosity.
      He started contributing from the get-go, but he wasn't just putting down code; he would question and propose his points of view, with some bringing a new look into some problems.
      
      He knows his way around. He thinks critically and works as a teammate.
      Whenever his opinions diverge, he presents proper arguments, knowing when they are refuted, and follows the chosen strategy.
      
      I know I can always share my thoughts about new developments on the frontend with him, because he, too, follows along with the trends. We enjoy sharing our passions of React, Next.js and Tailwind.
      
      Pedro has a keen eye for detail, and a particular interest on optimization. He's notoriously well versed on the frontend, but knows his way around the backend and DevOps.

    feedback: `Pedro is a forward-thinking developer with a wealth of knowledge.
      When I had the opportunity to work with Pedro, I was aware that his background as a developer was relatively short, but once we started working together, I realized how irrelevant years of experience are.
          
      Once you have Pedro as a resource, you won't be able to keep him out of your ideas or thoughts, whether they are related to UI/UX, API development or organizing a data model. His pragmatic approach always manages to raise questions that encourage you to think about what needs to be redefined or improved.
          
      Pedro has qualities that will ensure his success in the long run: he consistently produces work of a high standard and he is driven to learn everything he can.`,
